jedha project about sales prediction

Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

The project is divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : EDA of data and preprocessings in order to prepare data for machine learning
- Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)
- Part 3 : tain regularized models (ridge and lasso) and optimisation of hyperparameters thanks to gridsearchcv

Dataset contains information about weekly sales achieved by different Walmart stores, and other variables such as the unemployment rate or the fuel price, that might be useful for predicting the amount of sales.
